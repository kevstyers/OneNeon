# OneNeon
This is a repository for all of the NEON data plotters that I make for fun. Currently there is only the VST application that is very simple and plots all of the vst data from the NEON portal. It is still in the draft phase. The idea behind this repo is to track changes and developments of applications and cleaning scripts as they progress from draft quality to production quality.

## Motivation
To produce easy to use applications that show the utility of NEON data. I feel is a great way to spread knowledge of the NEON data products as well as develop my own skills with in R. Hopefully this project will grow beyond just myself and catalyze the production of many exploratory data analysis tools
